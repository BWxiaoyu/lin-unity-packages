## Button Inventory: [https://youtu.be/OtltuDNuuko](https://youtu.be/OtltuDNuuko)
A stop action, touch-based inventory system. Can be used to add an extreme amount of animations and objects to your avatar.
## Drop Bed: [https://youtu.be/WIYPGzzmFvM](https://youtu.be/WIYPGzzmFvM)
A mesh world particle bed which is 100% stable in world space with no position or rotation jitter. Oriented properly in local space using inherit velocity subemission and align to velocity rendering.
## Following Drone: [https://youtu.be/8SXjH_6tu48](https://youtu.be/8SXjH_6tu48)
This prefab uses a series of joints to make an object appear less like it is connected to your avatar.
## Mixamo Gestures: No preview yet
These are the standard VRChat hand poses, free to use from Mixamo.
## Multi-Hand Trigger: [https://youtu.be/8-Xq4ycNmJo](https://youtu.be/8-Xq4ycNmJo)
Animate on a particular combination of gestures, *without* disabling child objects. Safe and reliable way to do state management with gestures.
## On-Release Trigger: [https://youtu.be/EjWEGT4HaTE](https://youtu.be/EjWEGT4HaTE)
Animate on gesture release, without disabling child objects.  
## Performance Cube: [https://youtu.be/SsiQx4IcqGc](https://youtu.be/SsiQx4IcqGc)
This is a big invisible cube. This will improve the sync rate of animator systems. Good for avatars which do performances and need consistency even if a person isn't looking at you.
## Physics Projectile: [https://youtu.be/opLUJeM8qqM](https://youtu.be/opLUJeM8qqM)
An object which is controlled by physics. You can easily replace the effects. Collides with the world using physics, but detonation is manual. Good example of an interface built with multi-hand trigger.
## Player Local Kit: No preview yet
Prefabs for player local animation. Multiple field prefabs which play local animations on field entry and exit. A gesture based player local touch prefab is also included. 
## Single Fire Particle: No preview yet
This is a particle system prefab that will fire once per override, without garbage keyframes, without disabling game objects, without a broken emitter pair, without an animator, and without any visual interruption when you release the override. If you need a delay you can add it to the child particle, or other particles you decide to sub-emit.
## Sound On Collision: No preview yet
Play audio on the death of a particle. By default, the particle is set up to die on collision, and is managed by an override.
## Stop Action Kit: No preview yet
Perform contact-based animations. Animation on particle death.
## Suspend Animator: No preview yet
Blueprint animator and animations for creating persistent animated states. Comes with emote example.
## World Fixed IK: [https://youtu.be/1oL1ZNoKBxo](https://youtu.be/1oL1ZNoKBxo)
This is a world fixed object, held in place by a limb ik script connected to nothing. More stable than physics. *Can be combined with physics.* (This requires Final IK 1.6 or 1.7)
## World Fixed Joint: [https://youtu.be/k8CZ-pUoYv8](https://youtu.be/k8CZ-pUoYv8)
World fixed joint prefabs with integrated reset and 2017.4 bugfix. Emote and gesture prefabs.
